			<h2>What is HivePoint?</h2>
			<p>We are a small team that is passionate about building a fully interactive web. We are the people behind
				<a href='https://braid.io'>Braid magazine</a> which provides us with a way to use interactivity to tell interesting stories in a new way. The expertise and tools we have developed enable us to assist companies that share our view that the future of
				the web is through deep interactivity.
			</p>
			<p>We work on contracts where we can use our creative and technical skills to help to solve challenging problems.
			</p>

			<h2>Show me an example</h2>
			<p>Communicating with people is about telling stories. In the past, that meant writing. For example,
				<a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/lyme-disease-carrying-ticks-are-now-half-all-us-counties'>here</a> is a well written 700 word article from Science Magazine about the spread of Lyme Disease. It even includes a map showing this spread.
			</p>
			<p>We were also interested in this story, but <a href='https://braid.io/tile/lyme-disease-trends'>we tell it</a> in a different way, using interactivity, eliminating most of the reading and inviting the reader to explore the data themselves interactively.</p>
			<p>Your website, product, or sales presentation is also telling a story. We can help make it more engaging and effective through interactivity.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What is your process?</h2>
			<p>Every project is different and we are good at adapting. But we always start by listening.  We want to understand the problem and opportunity. This doesn't require much time. We're listening especially for a natural entry point -- the "tip of the
				spear" where we can offer a solution to a small part of the problem that is the first step on a longer path.
			</p>
			<p>We return with a proposal including a few broad concepts and a specific proposal for a narrowly defined solution to that first problem. Often this will be something that can be developed and deployed in a matter of weeks. This builds trust, confidence,
				and deeper understanding of the big picture.
			</p>
			<p>We then rapidly prototype the solution and deliver it in the way that fits best for the situation. In many cases, this is something that can be dropped into an existing resource (like a website or presentation) with a minimum of disruption.				
			</p>
			<p>Along the way, we communicate with you through an interactive channel built on top of standard email.  This is another of our interactive web creations,
				called <a href="https://channels.cc">channels.cc</a>.  We create a new channel for each project so that stakeholders all have a single place to go to
				see all of the project-related communications -- even as the project team evolves.
			</p>
			<p>If everyone is pleased, then we repeat this process iteratively, building towards a comprehensive solution for the original opportunity.</p>

			<h2>Show me another example</h2>
			<p>When nine prisoners were recently released from the Guantanamo Bay prison, the Guardian wrote
				<a href='http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/16/guantanamo-bay-prisoners-released-yemen-saudi-arabia'>this 1000 word story</a> about it.</p>
			<p>We told <a href='https://braid.io/tile/guantanamo-bay-detainees'>the story of the Guantanamo Bay detainees</a> by using interactive graphics to let readers visualize and explore the data.</p>
			<p>We can take these same concepts and apply them to your problem, improving your customer's experience.</p>
